# Supply Chain Cost Analysis (Study-Project)

## Project Overview

This study project involved creating a dashboard to analyze supply chain data for a fictional company. The primary goal was to evaluate supplier costs, perform scenario planning based on volume changes, and conduct make-vs-buy analyses to support procurement decisions.

## Data Source

* **Dataset:** Fictitious Request for Proposal (RFP) responses for make-vs-buy decisions.
* **Source:** an Excel file by Datacamp.

## Tools Used

* **Microsoft Excel:** Utilized for initial data cleaning and preparation of the RFP response data from the Excel file.
* **Microsoft Power BI:** Employed after data cleaning in Excel for data modeling, final analysis, and creation of the dashboard.

## Analysis & Visualizations

The project involved several analytical steps reflected in the dashboard:


* **Supplier Cost Comparison:** Analyzing Unit Cost, Extended Cost, Full Cost, and Non-recurring Expenses across different suppliers based on order volume. Identifying the lowest-cost supplier for specific parts and volumes.
* **Scenario Planning:** Implementing a volume parameter to calculate and visualize how total costs change for different suppliers as order volume changes.
* **Make vs. Buy Analysis:** Comparing the cost of buying parts from suppliers vs making them in-house to determine cost avoidance opportunities.
* **Security Implementation:** Row-Level Security was added to restrict data access based on supplier roles.

## Key Findings & Insights (Examples from Dashboard)

* The lowest-cost supplier varies depending on the specific part number and the order volume scenario.
* Non-recurring expenses and unit costs change differently with volume for each supplier.
* Make-vs-buy analysis indicates potential cost avoidance by choosing the sourcing method.
* The scenario planner allows for cost comparisons based on projected volumes.

**As part of my Power BI learning process, this dashboard was created in early 2024 as a study project using a fictitious dataset to practice analytical techniques in supply chain analysis. While it demonstrates analytical concepts, reviewing it now highlights areas for improvement in styling, chart design, and layout, showcasing the evolution of my skills since its creation.**
